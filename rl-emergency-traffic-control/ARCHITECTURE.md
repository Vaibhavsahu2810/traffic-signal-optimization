For **training**, the real system is replaced by a **traffic simulator**.

Typical simulator used:
**SUMO**

---

# 2. System Components

## 2.1 Traffic State Extraction Layer

This converts raw sensor data into a **numerical state vector** for RL.

Inputs:

* Camera feeds
* Loop sensors
* GPS vehicle data

Computer vision models detect:

* vehicle count
* vehicle types
* queue length
* emergency vehicles

Example detection models:

* **YOLOv8**
* **Mask R-CNN**

Output example:

```json
{
  "intersection_id": "I23",
  "lane_1_vehicle_count": 15,
  "lane_2_vehicle_count": 12,
  "queue_length": 20,
  "ambulance_detected": false,
  "heavy_vehicle_count": 3
}
```

# 3. Reinforcement Learning Model Design

This is the **core of the system**.

Each intersection = **agent**.

Algorithms commonly used:

* **Deep Q-Network**
* **Proximal Policy Optimization**
* **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**

---

# 4. RL Environment Definition

Reinforcement learning requires defining:

```
State
Action
Reward
Environment
Policy
```

---

# 5. State Space (Traffic State)

The **state vector** represents current traffic conditions.

Example:

```text
S = [
vehicle_count_lane_1
vehicle_count_lane_2
vehicle_count_lane_3
vehicle_count_lane_4
queue_length
average_waiting_time
current_signal_phase
neighbor_intersection_flow
time_of_day
rush_hour_flag
ambulance_flag
]
```

Example numeric vector:

```text
[12, 8, 5, 15, 20, 18, 2, 7, 18.5, 1, 0]
```

Explanation:

| Feature        | Meaning                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| vehicle count  | cars waiting per lane                      |
| queue length   | total queued vehicles                      |
| neighbor flow  | vehicles entering from nearby intersection |
| rush hour      | 0 or 1                                     |
| ambulance flag | emergency detected                         |

Typical **state dimension**

```
20–50 features
```

---

# 6. Action Space

Actions represent **signal changes**.

Example action space:

```text
A0 → keep current signal
A1 → switch to north-south green
A2 → switch to east-west green
A3 → extend green by 10 seconds
A4 → give priority to emergency lane
```

Example discrete actions:

```
0–4
```

More advanced systems use **continuous actions**.

Example:

```
green_time = 10–60 seconds
```

---

# 7. Reward Function (Most Important)

The reward tells the model **what good traffic flow means**.

Common reward formula:

```
Reward = -(total_waiting_time + queue_length + congestion)
```

Example:

```
R = - (0.5 * waiting_time + 0.3 * queue_length + 0.2 * delay)
```

Additional rewards:

Emergency vehicle priority:

```
+50 if ambulance cleared quickly
```

Congestion penalty:

```
-100 if queue exceeds threshold
```

Goal:

```
maximize traffic throughput
minimize waiting time
```

---

# 8. Multi-Intersection Coordination

Because intersections interact, agents share information.

Road network is represented as a **graph**.

Nodes = intersections
Edges = roads

Example:

```
A ─── B ─── C
│
D
```

Agents exchange data:

```
cars leaving A → entering B
```

State augmentation:

```
neighbor_queue_lengths
neighbor_signal_phase
```

This allows coordination.
